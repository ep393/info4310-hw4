## Overview
This document critiques and suggests improvements for visualizations dealing with alcohol consumption patterns globally and historically in the United States. The data sources include the World Health Organization and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

## Critique of the Existing Visualization

### Source Data and Visualization
The provided visualizations aim to present global and historical U.S. alcohol consumption data in an easily digestible format. However, while they succeed in delivering data effectively, they lack interactivity and could be misinterpreted due to their static nature.

#### Global Alcohol Consumption by Type
- **Design**: Tabular layout with numerical values.
- **Pros**: Allows quick comparison across countries and beverage types.
- **Cons**: Lacks visual impact and interactive elements, which could enhance user engagement.

#### U.S. Alcohol Consumption Over Time
- **Design**: Line graph.
- **Pros**: Effectively displays trends over time with color coding for different beverage types.
- **Cons**: The line representing 'All beverages' could be misinterpreted as another category rather than a sum of all types.

### Suggested Improvements
- **Interactivity**: Adding interactive elements like tooltips and dynamic charts could improve engagement and understanding.
- **Contextual Information**: More background on data collection and conversion methods would help avoid potential misunderstandings.

## Improved Visualization

### Source Data and Visualization
Utilizing a more comprehensive dataset from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, I developed new visualizations that maintain simplicity and clarity while enhancing interactivity and user experience.

#### Choropleth Map
- **Features**: Uses color gradients to indicate levels of consumption and interactive tooltips for detailed data.
- **Interaction**: Users can hover over states for specific data, enhancing engagement and providing immediate visual differentiation.

#### Line Graph of Ethanol Consumption
- **Features**: Refinement in the display of trends and interactive data points.
- **Interaction**: Users can explore detailed consumption data for specific years and compare trends with the national average.

#### Ethanol Consumption by Type
- **Features**: Comparative analysis with clear axes and distinct colors for each beverage type.
- **Interaction**: Detailed information available through interaction, allowing users to trace consumption history of beer, spirit, and wine.

## Conclusion
The enhancements in the visualizations not only make the data more accessible but also empower users to interact with the data, drawing their own conclusions and insights from the visualizations.
